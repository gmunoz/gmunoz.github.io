Back when I used to write systems-level software the biggest pet peeves I had were checking every single error case for functions that called out to the OS. Not just seeing if an error had happened so that I could not-so-gracefully die, but to check the different error cases, log the precise system-specific message, and handle the error in a way that makes sense for the application.

**At least be capable of logging specific errors as soon as they happen.**

I even wrote a set of [Perl scripts to read man pages that would output C code](https://github.com/gmunoz/galaxy/tree/master/liberror/scripts) with meaningful error messages for error return values. That stuff is ages old (seems to be from 2004--too long for me to remember) and probably doesn't work any more but I used variations of it in large systems. It worked surprisingly well.

Got a new project you're working on? Re-tool it to excessively check its assumptions and start fixing stuff.

I think one of the keys to mastery is [figuring out how your language community approaches solving the resilience of its systems](https://joearms.github.io/2013/04/28/Fail-fast-noisely-and-politely.html). This is one of the elements I look at when deciding what next language to learn.
